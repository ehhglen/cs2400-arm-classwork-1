CS2400 ARM assembly programming classwork problems.

## C and assembly code

Follow the instructions for each of the following code samples in [Compliler Explorer](https://godbolt.org).

1. [printf](https://godbolt.org/z/y2YKew)
   1. What is the library function that is called? The library function that is called is <stdio.h>
   2. Research the implementation (source code) of this function. This function implements different syntax in order for the program to do certain things such as file input and output. 
   3. Find out if the program directly executes the output operation or it makes a *system call* to the operating system. The program        does not make a system call; it executes the operation
   
2. [malloc](https://godbolt.org/z/kAZX7x)
   1. How are the arguments passed to `malloc` and `free`? The arguments are being passed through registers by moving and storing. 
   2. Research the implementation (source code) of `malloc` and `free`. 'malloc' allocates memory and returns a pointer to it. 'free' deallocates the memory that was previosly allocated by malloc.
   
3. [malloc array](https://godbolt.org/z/bBl0zx)
   1. How does this case differ from the previous one? In this case, an array was declared of size 100.
   2. [**hard**] Write your own tiny `malloc` by declaring a large `FILL` area and writing a `malloc` and a `free` subroutine.
   
4. [arrays](https://godbolt.org/z/lcH006)
   1. Port this code to VisUAL.
   2. Observe/show that this code writes the local array in reverse order to the `static` global array.
   
5. [2d array](https://godbolt.org/z/Kr-Sn8)
   1. Port this code to VisUAL.
   2. How are nested `for` loops handled in assembly? Are they *"nested"* in assembly?
   
6. [2d array with mul](https://godbolt.org/z/cHwSTR)
   1. Port this code to VisUAL. (It's the same as the previous but with multiplicatoin).
   2. Add your 32-bit unsigned integer multiplication algorithm as a subroutine and run the code. Verify its correctness.
